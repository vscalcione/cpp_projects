## C++ projects

This is my repository with all the sources related to **programming in c and c ++**
<br>
The compiling and execution procedure of the various sources changes according to the operating system in use
<br>
<strong>If use Windows:</strong>
- clone repository with git-bash 
```bash
$ git clone "https://github.com/vscalcione/cpp_projects
$ cd cpp_projects
```
- compile and execute only single source-code with your preferite IDE. In this case I use **Clion** but you can use only c/c++ IDE <br>
<strong>If use Linux or Unix-like OS:</strong>
The IDE issue is the same as that for Windows but you can also compile and execute everything from the command line
- If you choose IDE's way, you can install any IDE for C/c++. For example, I used Jetbrains's Clion
- If you choose command line way, type these commands on terminal
- In any case remember to comment the lines of code in which you find ***system("cls")*** and to uncomment those in which you find ***system ("clear")***
```bash
$ git clone "https://github.com/vscalcione/cpp_projects
$ cd cpp_projects
$ g++ ${fileName}.cpp -o /output/${fileName}
$ cd output && ./${fileName}
```
