# C++ projects

This is my repository with all sources code related to ***programming in C/C++***. The compiling and execution procedure of all sources code changes in according to the operating system in use

### If you use Windows
- clone the repository with git-bash and execute this command for cloning the repos.
```bash
$ git clone "https://github.com/vscalcione/cpp_projects"
$ cd cpp_projects
```
- compile and execute only single source with your preferite IDE. In this case I use ***Clion (Jetbrains)*** but you can use only C/C++ IDE

### If you use Linux OS:
- The IDE issue is the same as that for Windows but you can also compile and execute everything form the command line
- If you choose IDE's way, you can install any C/C++ IDE. For example, I used ***Clion (Jetbrains)***
- If you choose command line way, type theese commands on terminal
```bash
$ git clone "https://github.com/vscalcione/cpp_projects
$ cd cpp_projects
$ g++ ${fileName}.cpp -o /output/${fileName}
$ cd output && ./${fileName}
```
